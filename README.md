# lingo

Lingo is one of the assignments I had to complete at RefactorU. In this assignment I had to implement the Google Translate API. I used this along with Angular, express.js, and node.js to allow users to pick a language and get a word or phrase translated. I also implemented a quiz options where users will be presented with randomly generated words and asked to translate them. Users will see how many words they can get correct before missing three.
